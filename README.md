## ⭐ Featured projects

- **[Isolation_Forest_Anomaly_IDS](https://github.com/Ayman-Singh/Isolation_Forest_Anomaly_IDS)**  
  Anomaly detection pipeline using Isolation Forest for network telemetry. Includes preprocessing scripts, model training, and a lightweight visualization / evaluation dashboard.
  I  would welcome some open source contributions for this project as this project has vast scope and real life application for Intruition Detection Systems

- **[LOWLIGHTEN_IMAGE_ENHANCEMENT](https://github.com/Ayman-Singh/LOWLIGHTEN_IMAGE_ENHANCEMENT)**  
    An idea i had to reimagine dark pictures of environments (dark rooms) as if they were well lighten .

- **[AI-Interviewer](https://github.com/Ayman-Singh/AI-Interviewer)**  
   a Gemini based AI internviwer with Go backend and Reactjs Frontend . I built it to create a platform for self paced Interview practice
