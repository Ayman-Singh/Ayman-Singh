# 👋 Hi — I'm Ayman Singh
**3rd-year B.Tech (CSE) — IIT Jammu** · ML & Computer Vision · eBPF & Systems · Open to internships

I build end-to-end ML systems and practical tools that solve real problems — from experimentation and model training to small production demos and systems-level tooling. I enjoy computer vision, applied machine learning, and low-level networking (eBPF). Currently focused on improving model reproducibility, concise demos, and clear reproducible READMEs for projects.

## 🔭 What I work on
- **Machine Learning & Computer Vision:** experiments, notebooks, model evaluation and simple dashboards.  
- **Systems & Networking:** eBPF-based tooling, C/C++ utilities, and low-level data processing.  
- **Prototyping & Demos:** short, reproducible demos (GIFs/screenshots) that show the result quickly.

## ⭐ Featured projects
> (Click a repo to open it on GitHub — each repo contains a short demo or notebook)

- **[Isolation_Forest_Anomaly_IDS](https://github.com/Ayman-Singh/Isolation_Forest_Anomaly_IDS)**  
  Anomaly detection pipeline using Isolation Forest for network telemetry. Includes preprocessing scripts, model training, and a lightweight visualization / evaluation dashboard.

- **[LOWLIGHTEN_IMAGE_ENHANCEMENT](https://github.com/Ayman-Singh/LOWLIGHTEN_IMAGE_ENHANCEMENT)**  
  Notebooks and experiments comparing classical and learning-based low-light enhancement methods. Good for quick visual comparisons and reproducible examples.

- **[C_Function_Call_Parser](https://github.com/Ayman-Singh/C_Function_Call_Parser)**  
  C++ static parsing tool that extracts and analyzes function calls from C source — useful for static analysis and instrumentation experiments.

- **[AI-Interviewer](https://github.com/Ayman-Singh/AI-Interviewer)**  
  Lightweight JavaScript demo for an interactive interviewer flow — nice to include as a frontend prototype.

- **[eBPF_Traffic_Shaping](https://github.com/Ayman-Singh/eBPF_Traffic_Shaping)**  
  Forked traffic shaping policy using eBPF — demonstrates systems networking knowledge and practical packet handling.

## 🎓 Education & roles
- **B.Tech, Computer Science & Engineering** — *IIT Jammu* (final year)  
- **CGPA:** 7.1  
- **Other:** Maths teacher at Kritash Club — experience explaining concepts clearly and building lesson flow.

---

## 🏆 Selected achievements
- **Inter IIT Tech Meet 13.0** — placed 16 / 23 in event competitions.  
- Shortlisted for internship opportunities (actively applying to industry internships including roles that focus on ML, systems, and backend engineering).

---

## ✅ What I care about in projects
- Clear **one-line goal** at the top of the README.  
- A **5–10 second demo (GIF or image)** so results are immediately visible.  
- **Quickstart** with ≤3 commands to run the demo locally.  
- Concise notes on dataset(s), model, and evaluation (when applicable).

---

## 📫 Get in touch
- Best way to reach me is via my **GitHub profile**: https://github.com/Ayman-Singh  
  (Open an issue on a repo you care about, or comment on code — I check GitHub activity first.)

---

## ⚡ Quick help I can give
If you want, I will:
- Draft a tight, recruiter-focused README for **one chosen repo** (with a copy-ready demo header and quickstart).  
- Create a 5–8s GIF recipe and the exact commands to generate it for a selected notebook/project.  
- Reorder/pick the 4–6 pinned repositories so your profile catches recruiter attention immediately.

Tell me which repo to start with (pick one from your pinned list) and I’ll produce a polished repo README for that project — with no placeholders and ready-to-commit content.
